The game now has four playable characters and each has two special abilities. The next step I suggest is to improve on the game AI. The current AI does random movement when it’s far to the player and switches to be aggressive when being close. It is slightly more complicated than before since the AI knows to use special abilities now. I suggest implementing better dodging scheme so the AI behavior can feel more human-like.

Apart from the AI, one can also improve the visual effect (fighting games all come with over-the-top effects). For instance, adding halos or flickering colors to the power punch.

In terms of gameplace comments, I feel it is hard to regain the distance once the AI is close to the player. In the current version, the AI can “stick” to the player and keep punching. A more reasonable fighting game should avoid this situation. Some solutions are (1) forbidding characters to overlap; (2) making the character fly after being hit by a combo (a certain number of punches).
